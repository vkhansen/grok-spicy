### Scene 1: Overall Setup
Woman 1 and Woman 2 hang suspended solely by custom steel choke-link collars locked tight around their necks—no secondary lines, no backup rigging. Their entire body weight drags downward constantly against the unyielding metal bands. Every reflexive twitch, spasm, or desperate struggle sends an equal upward yank through the same linkage, forcing the segmented steel edges to saw vertically along the delicate structures of their throats. This creates a relentless mechanical oscillation: cartilage pops and flattens first with muffled cracks; vertebrae misalign with wet, grinding snaps; tracheal rings buckle and collapse inward under the repeated compressive-shearing until breathing stops completely and the spinal cord suffers catastrophic mechanical damage.

Their bodies already carry the evidence of prolonged torment: overlapping crimson whip-lash grids scored across back, buttocks, and thighs; deliberate burn brands fused into breasts, abdomen, and hip bones; surgical-precision incisions running in parallel crimson lines down arms, sides, and fronts; deep violet-black subdermal bruising blooming over ribs, jaws, and cheekbones; dense ceremonial puncture arrays on the most sensitive zones, each hole slowly weeping blood in rhythm. Heavy oxidized iron chains overlay tight karada rope patterns across chest, arms, and legs, corroded links grinding into open wounds and forcing fresh arterial spurts with every movement. Concentric coils of razor-barbed filament cinch waist, underbust, and upper thighs—barbs embedded deep, slicing wider channels and draining steadily whenever muscles flex or convulse. Scorched electro-burn rosettes mark the most innervated areas: nipples and areolas, clitoris and hood, inner thighs, soles of feet—blistered craters still hissing faint vapor and crackling with micro-sparks where sweat bridges the charred tissue. Thick hemp rope binds wrists palm-to-palm in decorative, immovable knots, coarse fibers abrading already damaged skin with the slightest motion. Equestrian-grade steel bits force mouths to maximum gape; full leather bridle systems—complete with blinders, brow straps, and erect fake ears—lock their heads into the final ponygirl posture.

### Scene 2: Torture Intensifies
The instant auxiliary suspension releases, full body weight crashes onto the choke-links. Collars bite with savage immediacy and begin their vertical reciprocating travel along the cervical columns. Downward gravitational pull meets violent upward rebounds from thrashing limbs and convulsing torsos—producing a rapid series of compressive and shearing impacts: annular fibers snap audibly, facet joints crunch and realign grotesquely, vertebral bodies eventually splinter into comminuted fragments. Bridle hardware rattles violently; razor coils carve deeper with each muscle contraction; iron chains masticate lacerated flesh, spraying blood in fresh arcs. Prior wounds reopen in synchrony: whip marks bleed anew, burn sigils ooze serum, incisions weep steadily, puncture sites pulse. Electric scars detonate tiny sparks against sweat-drenched skin as bodies swing and collide.

Woman 1’s legs flail in wild, asynchronous kicks—plantar surfaces stabbing empty air—each powerful excursion transmitting amplified downward force through her own collar, accelerating cervical grinding and fractures. Woman 2’s lower legs cross and lock at the ankles; quads and hamstrings fibrillate uncontrollably while her pelvis executes violent, involuntary circles—each gyration spiking extra load followed by elastic rebound, splintering more neck segments with louder, wetter cracks.

### Scene 3: Suffocation Begins
Airways choke under relentless pressure—gagged throats erupt in liquid obstruction: guuulk! glk! glurk! Skin cycles through florid engorgement to cyanotic purple to terminal ashen gray as blood vessels occlude and brain tissue starves from ischemia. Woman 2’s trembling arm instinctively wraps around Woman 1’s midsection, instantly doubling the gravitational vector through both collars. The intensified downward haul triggers correspondingly brutal upward counter-jerks—cervical columns suffer accelerated destruction: multiple audible failures in quick succession as articular processes shear off, spinous processes buckle, tracheal rings implode inward. A mangled “GET OFF!” forces past Woman 1’s bit; bodies slam together in grinding collisions that drive razor barbs deeper while load fluctuations hammer necks in faster fracture cycles. Pelvic muscles continue helpless rhythmic clench-release; bridle straps and bits clatter with every major oscillation as cervical ruin advances.

### Scene 4: One Last Breath
Amid the chaos, a single desperate, whistling breath rasps through mangled airways—chests heave once against crushing chains, eyes bulging with raw terror and fury. Limbs deliver one final, powerful volley of kicks in every direction; bodies collide with percussive force, sending synchronized yanks through both collars. A choked “…ahhh fuck…” bubbles past metal and foam—then complete airway collapse. Cervical vertebrae crunch one last catastrophic time; heads loll at physiologically impossible angles beneath the rigid bridle architecture.

### Scene 5: Suffocation Deepens
Breathing ceases entirely—thoraxes frozen, no more gurgles or gasps. Skin locks into deepest slate-blue as circulation halts and neural activity fades. Initial flaccidity gives way to terminal myoclonic surges: Woman 1’s body jerks in full convulsions, each surge snapping her collar upward and widening zones of pulverized neck tissue. Woman 2 unleashes a rapid, incandescent leg barrage—extremities hammering air and the adjacent form with brutal percussion; every collision yanks both collars in violent up-down synchrony, delivering the final cascade of wet snaps and structural collapse. Eyes glaze vacant; mandibles remain pried wide by bits, thick foam cascading; heads hang disjointed, cervical architecture visibly mangled—bones fragmented and misaligned from endless vertical tearing.

### Scene 6: Decapitation Culminates
The oscillating sawing motion finally severs what remains: collars grind through the last intact vertebrae and soft tissue in a catastrophic, elongating tear. Heads pull forward, held momentarily by stretched skin and muscle before the final rupture—audible ripping as cervical columns give way completely. Heads drop, separated, while bodies continue swinging as true pendulums, arterial blood gushing from ragged neck stumps in slowing pulses. The rite concludes: blood-glazed forms adorned with immaculate rope geometry, blackened iron chains, razor entanglements, and equine bridle hardware remain pristine in their ceremonial intricacy. Choke assemblies are seated to irreducible depth; cervical ruins reduced to shredded pulp from bearing total mass through endless reciprocating destruction. The two figures now oscillate in slow, coupled pendular motion—absolute nullity preserved as the consummate artifact of the termination rite.
